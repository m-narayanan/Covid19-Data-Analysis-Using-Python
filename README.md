# COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python

## Data Analysis and Visualization: Examining the Relationship Between COVID-19 and Global Happiness

### Description
This project focuses on data analysis and visualization to investigate the relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and happiness levels across different countries. It has three primary objectives:

1. **Preparing Datasets for Analysis**
   - Learn how to preprocess and merge datasets for analysis.
2. **Identifying Key Measures**
   - Calculate relevant metrics to answer critical questions.
3. **Visualizing the Analysis Results**
   - Create meaningful visualizations to effectively convey insights.

The datasets are sourced from a course by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera, instructed by Ahmad Varasteh. One dataset consists of the cumulative daily confirmed COVID-19 cases for each country, while the other includes scores for various life factors from people living in those countries. By merging these datasets, we aim to explore the question:

**Is there a correlation between the spread of COVID-19 and the happiness levels of a countryâ€™s population?**

### Project Structure

- **Task 1: Introduction**
  - Understand the project's objectives, datasets, and the key questions to be answered through analysis.
  
- **Task 2: Importing and Preparing the COVID-19 Dataset**
  - Clean and preprocess the COVID-19 dataset by removing unnecessary columns and aggregating the data.

- **Task 3: Defining Key Metrics**
  - Determine and calculate appropriate metrics for the analysis.
  
- **Task 4: Importing and Preparing the World Happiness Report Dataset**
  - Import the World Happiness Report dataset, clean it by dropping irrelevant columns, and merge it with the COVID-19 data to explore potential correlations.

- **Task 5: Visualizing the Results**
  - Use Seaborn to visualize the results and identify relationships between the variables.

### Data Sources
- COVID-19 cases dataset (Johns Hopkins University)
- World Happiness Report dataset (Coursera)

### Technologies Used
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas** for dataset cleaning and merging
- **Seaborn** for data visualization
