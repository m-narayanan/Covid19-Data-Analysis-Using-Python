COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python
Title: Data Analysis and Visualization: Examining the Relationship Between COVID-19 and Global Happiness
Description:
This project focuses on data analysis and visualization to investigate the relationship between COVID-19's spread and happiness levels across various countries. The project has three primary objectives:

Preparing Datasets for Analysis
Learn how to preprocess and merge datasets for analysis.
Identifying Key Measures
Calculate relevant metrics to address critical questions.
Visualizing the Analysis Results
Create meaningful visual representations to effectively convey insights.
The datasets used are from a course offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera, instructed by Ahmad Varasteh. One dataset tracks the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in each country, while the other includes various life factors scored by residents in each country. By merging these two datasets, we aim to explore the question:

Is there a correlation between the spread of COVID-19 and the happiness levels of a country’s population?

Project Structure/Tasks:
Task 1: Introduction
Understand the project’s objectives, datasets, and the key questions to be answered through analysis.

Task 2: Importing and Preparing the COVID-19 Dataset
Clean and preprocess the COVID-19 dataset by removing unnecessary columns and aggregating relevant data.

Task 3: Defining Key Metrics
Determine and calculate appropriate measures for the analysis.

Task 4: Importing and Preparing the World Happiness Report Dataset
Import the World Happiness Report dataset, clean it by dropping irrelevant columns, and merge it with the COVID-19 data to analyze correlations.

Task 5: Visualization
Use Seaborn to visualize the results and explore relationships between the variables.

Project Type:
This is a self-practiced project inspired by a guided project from Coursera.
